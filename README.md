# First_Coffee_WebSite
first web experience
This coffee site is my first website experience. 
I just used html/css. 
When customers enter the site, they have the opportunity to register and order the coffee they want from a coffee shop of their choice.
Since it is my first experience, this website is not that high quality. The first site I developed myself in the web field.
